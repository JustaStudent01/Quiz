In order to achieve this, we will use the programming language "JAVA" for the code hitself, with some touch of HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT in order to create a little introductory website. With this project, we hope to bring some fun to our users and improve our as much as possible our capabilities in this area. </p>
