# Introduction

Hello and thanks for reading this file! This file will show you everything we have in mind for this project about a quiz, and also some more extras!

# Our Goal

This project has as it's goal to make a quiz on an android enviroment with the recouse of "Android Studio" in order to test our users knowledge, make some fun tests, get little competitions within our userbase or just for them to have a little fun! In order to achieve this, we will use the programming language "JAVA" for the code hitself, with some touch of HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT in order to create a little introductory website. With this project, we hope to bring some fun to our users and improve our as much as possible our capabilities in this area. 

# Improvements

This quiz is some sort of "upgrade" to our lattest project, which was the same quiz, but on console with less features. It will be available on another repository (https://github.com/JustaStudent01/QuizConsoleApp). With this new project, we hope to improve some features and even add some more, create a good interface for the app, add a multiplayer gamemode, etc.
